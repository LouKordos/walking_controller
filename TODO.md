- 2 DOF ankle
- Make every dependency in setup.sh build from source so that it works on any OS (Gazebo Dependencies From Source -> Install from Source)
- Test more distros and their versions, then update README.md to mention that every version starting from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and up will work
- Install SWIG from source (http://swig.org/svn.html) (PCRE, YACC, Autoconf)
- Install IPOPT from source
- Only build packages that are not on ubuntu package search (including focal)
- Test different solvers
- For compiling casadi: `-DWITH_THREAD=ON` and install HSL solver with -NUM_THREADS
- Install MUMPS with multiple threads as shown in manual
- Test script with not installing casadi from pip (installing python3-dev will probably fix this)
- Test removing IPOPT path update for casadi install as done in the VM
- Current version for installing casADi: Install deps for casadi as instructed in github docs, install IPOPT from source (**USE 3.12 LINK TO SVN**), then install casADi with `cmake .. -DWITH_PYTHON3=ON -DWITH_PYTHON3=ON -DWITH_IPOPT=ON -DWITH_THREAD=ON` (be sure to install python3-dev and python3-matplotlib and **not** install casadi as requirement) 
- GDB
- Replace `std::endl` with `\n` where possible and use `std::flush` at the end to improve performance
- Try if casadi compile works without installing any IPOPT version and what version it would use
- Export loop time and solution time to CSV as well
- Make block operations fixed size to improve performance
- Add array of state history to biped plugin to send previous correct state that was not NaN instead of 0
- Combine all `0:N` loops into one
- Try running setup.sh with `sh setup.sh` instead of the more complex way, if it works, update `README.md`
- Add casadi benchmark to repo to test install
- Create `devel` branch
- VENV's FOR ALL PYTHON INSTALLS!!!!
