- Make internal class variables private, then only use get() and set() methods to make threadsafe
- Add seperate log directory
- Move legs 5cm closer to CoM, so that overall distance is 20cm, if not good enough move even closer
- FIX VARIBABLE NAMING!!!!!!
- 2 DOF ankle
- Autowrap for Python Notebooks, user more accurate naming for joints (instead of hip1 etc.)
- Properly automate conversion from Sympy expressions to C (maybe have the notebook create actual seperate files with the functions to prevent any user error)
- Make every dependency in setup.sh build from source so that it works on any OS
- Test more distros and their versions, then update README.md to mention that every version starting from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and up will work
- Test different solvers
- Ask Embedded Discord how to properly handle multithreading and code optimization in general, wrapping everything in `get()` function with mutex cannot be the right way to do it
- Check simulation paused in gazebo plugin and stop sending states to pause control plugin as well, otherwise simulation breaks after resuming
- For compiling casadi: `-DWITH_THREAD=ON` and install HSL solver with -NUM_THREADS
- Install MUMPS with multiple threads as shown in manual
- Test script with not installing casadi from pip (installing python3-dev will probably fix this)
- Test removing IPOPT path update for casadi install as done in the VM
- Current version for installing casADi: Install deps for casadi as instructed in github docs, install IPOPT from source (**USE 3.12 LINK TO SVN**), then install casADi with `cmake .. -DWITH_PYTHON3=ON -DWITH_PYTHON3=ON -DWITH_IPOPT=ON -DWITH_THREAD=ON` (be sure to install python3-dev and python3-matplotlib and **not** install casadi as requirement) 
- GDB
- `#define NUM_JOINTS X`
- Use fmtlib instead of stringstream garbage if possible
- Replace `std::endl` with `\n` where possible and use `std::flush` at the end to improve performance
- Try if casadi compile works without installing any IPOPT version and what version it would use
- Add array of state history to biped plugin to send previous correct state that was not NaN instead of 0
- Combine all `0:N` loops into one
- Try running setup.sh with `sh setup.sh` instead of the more complex way, if it works, update `README.md`
- Add casadi benchmark to repo to test install
- Use Bazel to compile project
- Maybe merge everything into one repository
- Install Gazebo with Bullet engine!!!
- Test setup script in WSL2
- Maybe mpc_config as well
- Decide proper naming scheme, either CamelCase or whatever_this_is_called
- Somehow add footstep locations to decision variables, or make it seperate optimization problem (one combined optimization for motion planning would be better to give solver intuition about the effects different footstep locations have)
- Consider rewriting NLP just using IPOPT and Pardiso/HSL solver to remove overhead and increase loop frequency, 60-100Hz should be the goal
- Use running average solver time for discretization dt
- Maybe Adaptive Horizon Length
- Customize Gazebo to Draw Ground reaction force vectors etc. (https://answers.gazebosim.org/question/3383/how-to-add-a-dynamic-visual-marker-in-gazebo/)
- Experiment with custom drawing in gazebo in general
- Maybe/Eventually Kalman Filter for Probability of Contact and/or Foot force estimation
- Add contact sensor to foot
- Soft contact model
- For advanced environment modelling: Either have a coordinate frame for world based on SLAM or try to get one frame for each foot to correctly orient feet
- f_min and f_max constraints as J*tau instead of constant forces (would have to assume angles are constant over prediction horizon) or add f_min and f_max to parameters to make them scale dynamically based on current orientation and torque limits
- ROS2 install from source in setup.sh!!!!
- Maybe reduce state bounds length by combining friction constraints and force limits (now just using -inf and inf)
- Test / Implement side stepping
- Make C++ MPC heavily multithreaded to scale for high core-count CPU's
- Multithreaded global state update
- https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt for printing out in same line
- meshgrid for reachability of leg
- Change `nx1` Matrices in Impedance Controller Code to Vectors
- Add slight yaw outwards on foot for better stability while walking
- RT Kernel, isolcpu, taskset
- Refactor code to use Eigen Matrix for r instead of seperate values
- Use class for tcp / udp communication so that there is one standard communication module that can easily be altered / swapped out (Protobuf messaging over TCP would be nice)
- Replace AF_INET with AF_UNIX: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20510016/client-server-socket-communication-af-unixa
- Alpine Docker containr to build everything from source
- InfluxDB live logging 
- vcpkg or conan
- Do actual performance validation and test suite with gazebo server docker container
