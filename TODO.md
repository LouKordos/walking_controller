- 2 DOF ankle
- Make every dependency in setup.sh build from source so that it works on any OS (Gazebo Dependencies From Source -> Install from Source)
- Test more distros and their versions, then update README.md to mention that every version starting from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and up will work
- Install SWIG from source (http://swig.org/svn.html) (PCRE, YACC, Autoconf)
- Install IPOPT from source
- Only build packages that are not on ubuntu package search (including focal)
- Test different solvers
- For compiling casadi: `-DWITH_THREAD=ON` and install HSL solver with -NUM_THREADS
- Install MUMPS with multiple threads as shown in manual
- Test script with not installing casadi from pip (installing python3-dev will probably fix this)
- Test removing IPOPT path update for casadi install as done in the VM
- Current version for installing casADi: Install deps for casadi as instructed in github docs, install IPOPT from source (**USE 3.12 LINK TO SVN**), then install casADi with `cmake .. -DWITH_PYTHON3=ON -DWITH_PYTHON3=ON -DWITH_IPOPT=ON -DWITH_THREAD=ON` (be sure to install python3-dev and python3-matplotlib and **not** install casadi as requirement) 
- GDB
- Replace `std::endl` with `\n` where possible and use `std::flush` at the end to improve performance
- Try if casadi compile works without installing any IPOPT version and what version it would use
- Export loop time and solution time to CSV as well
- Make block operations fixed size to improve performance
- Add array of state history to biped plugin to send previous correct state that was not NaN instead of 0
- Combine all `0:N` loops into one
- Try running setup.sh with `sh setup.sh` instead of the more complex way, if it works, update `README.md`
- Add casadi benchmark to repo to test install
- Create `develop` branch (Git flow model, so `feature/[feature_name]` as well)
- VENV's FOR ALL PYTHON INSTALLS!!!!
- Use X and Y axes for world inertia as well
- Use Bazel to compile project
- Maybe merge everything into one repository
- Try setup script on Manjaro
- Maybe install everything in catkin workspace
- Install Gazebo with Bullet engine!!!
- Test setup script in WSL2
- Somehow add footstep locations to decision variables, or make it seperate optimization problem (one combined optimization for motion planning would be better to give solver intuition about the effects different footstep locations have)
- Consider rewriting NLP just using IPOPT and Pardiso to remove overhead and increase loop frequency, 60-100Hz should be the goal
- Use running average solver time for discretization dt
- Maybe Adaptive Horizon Length
- Customize Gazebo to Draw Ground reaction force vectors etc. (https://answers.gazebosim.org/question/3383/how-to-add-a-dynamic-visual-marker-in-gazebo/)
- Experiment with custom drawing in gazebo in general
- Maybe/Eventually Kalman Filter for Probability of Contact and/or Foot force estimation
- Add contact sensor to foot
- Soft contact model
- For advanced environment modelling: Either have a coordinate frame for world based on SLAM or try to get one frame for each foot to correctly orient feet
- f_min and f_max constraints as J*tau instead of constant forces (would have to assume angles are constant over prediction horizon) or add f_min and f_max to parameters to make them scale dynamically based on current orientation and torque limits
- ROS2 install from source in setup.sh!!!!
- Maybe reduce state bounds length by combining friction constraints and force limits (now just using -inf and inf)
- Test / Implement side stepping
- PARDISO solver
- Make c++ MPC heavily multithreaded to scale for high core-count CPU's
- Try installing different solvers
- Test transition from walking to standing and the other way around
- Multithreaded global state update
- https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt for printing out in same line
- meshgrid for reachability of leg
- Print Debug in same Line c++
- Change `nx1` Matrices in Impedance Controller Code to Vectors
- Add slight yaw outwards on foot for better stability while walking
