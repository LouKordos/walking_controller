- Rename matrix elements in model functions to temp for easier parsing in future
- Test robustness (inertia and mass, disturbance)
- Use STL for model
- Calculate Euler Angles with Rotation matrix and compare
- Use step trajectory
- Create external tool for applying force for period of time / momentum
