- 2 DOF ankle
- Make every dependency in setup.sh build from source so that it works on any OS (Gazebo Dependencies From Source -> Install from Source)
- Look up what's needed for Gazebo 11 in "Dependencies from Source" and try out installing on Pop OS 19.10
- Install Gazebo10 from source (or look at how they install v11 when running via curl script and use that)
- After that is implemented, update README.md to mention that every version starting from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and up will work
- Install SWIG from source (http://swig.org/svn.html) (PCRE, YACC, Autoconf)
- Test install on 20.04
- Install IPOPT from source
- Only build packages that are not on ubuntu package search (including focal)
- Fix permission issues with make, git modifications (basically add read write permissions for everone on repos), then remove sudo on things like `make`
- Write about UDP comm in WSL
- Test different solvers
- Uninstall all dependecies before installing new version
- For compiling casadi: `-DWITH_THREAD=ON` and install HSL solver with -NUM_THREADS
- Test script with not installing casadi from pip (installing python3-dev will probably fix this)
- Test removing IPOPT path update for casadi install as done in the VM
- GDB
- `print_matrix` for DM for debugging
- Replace `std::endl` with `\n` where possible and use `std::flush` at the end to improve performance
